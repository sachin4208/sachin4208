# My Coding Journey

Hey there! I’m a student learning to code and having a blast doing it. I’m not an expert (yet!), but I’ve got **medium-level skills** in **Python**, **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **Flutter**. This portfolio is all about showing off what I’ve built so far—like my cool **Note Pad** project—and sharing my progress as I go!

## Star Project: Bidder Executive

**Bidder Executive** is my big project—a bidding system I made to test out my skills. It’s got a bit of everything I’m learning!

### What’s Cool About It
- Lets people bid on stuff (still figuring out real-time updates!).
- Users can log in and keep track of bids.
- Looks nice on phones and computers.
- Even has a Flutter app version I’m working on.

### How I Built It
- **Python**: Runs the behind-the-scenes stuff.
- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: Makes it look and feel good.
- **Flutter**: For the mobile side.

## More Fun Projects

Here’s some other stuff I’ve messed around with:

### Python: Guess the Number Game
- A little game where you guess a number—super simple but fun!
- **Code Bit**:
  ```python
  import random
  number = random.randint(1, 100)
  guess = int(input("Guess a number: "))
  if guess == number:
      print("You got it!")
